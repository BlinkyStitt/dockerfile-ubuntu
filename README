Container for Ubuntu: http://releases.ubuntu.com/16.04/

Docker needs extra steps to clean up images after installing packages (https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/eng-image/dockerfile_best-practices/) and I've had terrible luck with the apt mirrors failing so I wrote a helper with retries and Docker's best practices. Use `docker-apt-install PACKAGE` instead of `apt-get install PACKAGE` and installs will be reliable and keep the image as small as possible.

I still prefer to use the Alpine image since it is way smaller, but a lot of things are easy to install on Ubuntu.
