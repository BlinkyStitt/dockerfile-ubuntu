Container for Ubuntu: http://releases.ubuntu.com/16.04/

Docker needs extra steps to clean up images after installing packages (https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/eng-image/dockerfile_best-practices/) and I've had terrible luck with the apt mirrors failing so I wrote a helper with Docker's best practices and retries. Use `docker-apt-install PACKAGE` instead of `apt-get install PACKAGE` and installs will be reliable and keep the image as small as possible.

I still prefer to use the bwstitt/library-alpine image since it is way smaller, but a lot of things are easiest to install on Ubuntu since that is where the author develops them.
