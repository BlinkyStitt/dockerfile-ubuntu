Ubuntu

Container for Ubuntu: http://releases.ubuntu.com/16.04/

Check it out on Docker Hub: https://hub.docker.com/r/bwstitt/ubuntu/

Docker needs extra steps to clean up images after installing packages (https://docs.docker.com/engine/userguide/eng-image/dockerfile_best-practices/) and I've had terrible luck with the apt mirrors failing so I wrote a helper with Docker's best practices and retries. Use `docker-install PACKAGE` instead of `apt-get install PACKAGE` and installs will be reliable and keep the image as small as possible.

I prefer to use https://hub.docker.com/r/bwstitt/alpine since it is way smaller, but a lot of things are easiest to install on Debian/Ubuntu.
